# Music Recommender System

## Introduction
This is a music recommender system based on content-based filtering. It suggests music to users based on the characteristics of the music they have previously enjoyed. 

## Requirements
This system requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` as `np`
- `pandas` as `pd`
- `seaborn` as `sns`
- `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`
- `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`
- `cosine_similarity` from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`

Ensure that you have these libraries installed in your Python environment before running the system.

## Content-Based Filtering System
The content-based filtering system operates as follows:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Convert music metadata into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This step transforms textual information about music into numerical representations.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(music_metadata['description'])
```

2. **Calculate Similarity**: Compute the cosine similarity between music items based on their TF-IDF vectors. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two non-zero vectors.

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
```

3. **Recommendation**: Based on the similarity scores, recommend music items that are most similar to the ones the user has enjoyed in the past.

```python
def recommend_music(title, cosine_sim=cosine_sim):
    idx = indices[title]
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx]))
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    sim_scores = sim_scores[1:11]
    music_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]
    return music_metadata['title'].iloc[music_indices]
```

## Usage
To use the music recommender system, ensure you have the required libraries installed and import them into your Python environment. Then follow the content-based filtering steps outlined above to extract features, calculate similarity, and obtain recommendations based on user preferences.

## Note
- Ensure your music metadata is properly structured with descriptive information (e.g., descriptions, genres) for TF-IDF vectorization.
- Adjust parameters such as `stop_words` and other settings in the TF-IDF vectorization step based on your specific dataset and requirements.
- Customize the recommendation function (`recommend_music`) as needed to suit your application and user interface.
- This system assumes the existence of a dataset named `music_metadata` containing music metadata with relevant descriptive information. Adjust variable names accordingly if your dataset differs.
